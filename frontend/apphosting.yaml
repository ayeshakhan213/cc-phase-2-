# Firebase App Hosting Configuration (Legacy - Not Used for Vercel Deployment)
# This file is for reference only. The frontend is now deployed on Vercel.
#
# For Vercel Deployment:
# - Set environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL to your backend API URL
# - Backend is deployed on DigitalOcean VM with Docker
# - Use `npm run build` and `npm run start` for local testing
# - Vercel automatically detects Next.js and builds/deploys accordingly
#
# To deploy on Vercel:
# 1. Push code to GitHub
# 2. Connect repository to Vercel at https://vercel.com
# 3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# 4. Deploy (automatic on git push to main)

# Legacy Firebase App Hosting settings (preserved for reference)
runConfig:
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
